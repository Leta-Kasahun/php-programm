🐘 PHP Basics — Summary Notes
🔹 Variables

Variables are used to store data in PHP.
They begin with the $ symbol and do not require explicit type declaration.
Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and are case-sensitive.

🔹 Data Types

PHP supports several data types used to define the kind of value stored in a variable.
The main types include: string, integer, float (double), boolean, array, object, NULL, and resource.

🔹 Numbers

Numbers in PHP represent integer and floating-point values.
They are used for arithmetic operations and mathematical calculations.
PHP provides built-in functions to perform numeric tasks such as rounding and generating random values.

🔹 Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
They are used to store and manipulate textual data.
PHP provides various string functions for formatting, searching, and modifying text.

🔹 Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
It helps ensure the correct data type is used in calculations or operations.
PHP supports casting to integer, float, string, boolean, array, and object types.

🔹 Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on values and variables.
They are categorized into arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
Operators help perform calculations, comparisons, and decision-making in programs.

🔹 Variable Scope

Variable scope defines where a variable can be accessed within a program.
PHP has three main scopes: local (inside functions), global (outside functions), and static (retains value between function calls).
Understanding scope helps manage variable accessibility and lifetime.
