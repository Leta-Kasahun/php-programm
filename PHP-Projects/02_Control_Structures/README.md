🧩 PHP Control Structures — Summary Notes

🔹 If Statement
The if structure allows the program to make decisions by executing a block of code only when a specific condition is true.

🔹 If–Else Statement
This structure offers two possible paths. One block runs when the condition is true, and the other runs when the condition is false.

🔹 If–Elseif–Else Statement
Used when multiple conditions must be checked in sequence. Each condition is tested in order, and only the first true condition determines which block runs.

🔹 Switch Statement
A cleaner alternative to multiple elseif statements. It checks a single value against several predefined cases and executes the block that matches.

🔁 PHP Loops — Summary Notes

🔹 While Loop
Repeats a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true. The condition is checked before each repetition.

🔹 Do–While Loop
Similar to a while loop but guarantees at least one execution of the block before checking the condition.

🔹 For Loop
Ideal when the number of repetitions is known. It includes setup, condition checking, and updating in a single structured format.

🔹 Foreach Loop
Specialized for working with arrays or collections. It processes each element one by one, making it simple and readable for data iteration.
